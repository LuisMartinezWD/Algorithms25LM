##  Returning to Algorithms

Coming back to algorithms after a semester break—especially after writing code that wasn’t web development has been a bit of a struggle.  

I’ve noticed myself stumbling over problems I used to solve with ease.

##  Rebuilding Skills

To get back on track, I’ve been:

- Reviewing old code I previously wrote  
- Practicing problems on LeetCode
- Rebuilding my confidence and sharpening my problem solving mindset

##  Looking Ahead

Despite the initial challenges, I’m genuinely excited to continue this course.  
It feels much more aligned with the kind of work I’d encounter in a real world environment, definitely a lot more practical and immersive than some of my previous classes.
