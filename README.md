##  Returning to Algorithms

Coming into algorithms after a semester break of writing code that wasn't web development it has been a bit of a struggle

I’ve noticed myself struggling over problems I used to solve with ease.

##  Rebuilding Skills

To get back on track, I’ve been:

- Reviewing old code I previously wrote  
- Practicing problems on LeetCode
- Watching guides on youtube to get myself back into the coding mindset

---

##  Looking Ahead

Despite the initial struggle, I’m genuinely excited to continue this course since it is much more similar to a real workspace than what my other classes have been.



#  Week 5 Reflection

## Getting Closer to the skills I had before

Algorithms has been consistently racking at my brain, there have been questions where I have no idea whats going on.

Concepts completely alien to me. But also I have noticed that with every set of Leetcode problems thrown at us, I understand the concepts more and more.

I have gone from mindlessly staring at my screen in confusion to being able to solve some of these problems, it has been difficult but thats whats needed to see progress.
I had no idea algorithms went this deep, especially not as deep as im sure i'll see them go by the end of this semester.
