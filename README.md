##  Returning to Algorithms

Coming into algorithms after a semester break of writing code that wasn't web development it has been a bit of a struggle

I’ve noticed myself struggling over problems I used to solve with ease.

---

##  Rebuilding Skills

To get back on track, I’ve been:

- Reviewing old code I previously wrote  
- Practicing problems on LeetCode
- Watching guides on youtube to get myself back into the coding mindset

---

##  Looking Ahead

Despite the initial struggle, I’m genuinely excited to continue this course since it is much more similar to a real workspace than what my other classes have been.



#  Week 5 Reflection

## Getting Closer to the skills I had before

Algorithms has been consistently racking at my brain, there have been questions where I have no idea whats going on.

Concepts completely alien to me. But also I have noticed that with every set of Leetcode problems thrown at us, I understand the concepts more and more.

I have gone from mindlessly staring at my screen in confusion to being able to solve some of these problems, it has been difficult but thats whats needed to see progress.
I had no idea algorithms went this deep, especially not as deep as im sure i'll see them go by the end of this semester. 

#  Linked List Assignment

## Difficult but not the worst
This assignment made me think... THINK, it has been a long time since I've really sat down and coded something like this. While it was Karl teaching the class, it felt like we focused solely on the algorithm aspects and never really delved any deeper.

But this assignment was much, much different; it took a lot of googling and Visual Studio's integrated CoPilot to help me out, but I think assignments like this really do help with solidifying these concepts.



# Data Structure Assignmenmt

## Difficult as it included the usage of Maps, in this case a Dictionary. Until this point I have only ever heard of them, never trying to use them on my own. There was a LOT of googling done and I think I did it right? I'm not too sure to be honest, but this assignment was definitely something that I think was useful.

Like I said, I am not 100% confident this is correct at all, but I believe it is fairly close
