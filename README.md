#  Week 1/2 Reflection

##  Returning to Algorithms

Coming into algorithms after a semester break of writing code that wasn't web development it has been a bit of a struggle

I’ve noticed myself struggling over problems I used to solve with ease.

---

##  Rebuilding Skills

To get back on track, I’ve been:

- Reviewing old code I previously wrote  
- Practicing problems on LeetCode
- Watching guides on youtube to get myself back into the coding mindset

---

##  Looking Ahead

Despite the initial struggle, I’m genuinely excited to continue this course since it is much more similar to a real workspace than what my other classes have been.



#  Week 5 Reflection

## Getting Closer to the skills I had before

Algorithms has been consistently racking at my brain, there have been questions where I have no idea whats going on.

Concepts completely alien to me. But also I have noticed that with every set of Leetcode problems thrown at us, I understand the concepts more and more.

I have gone from mindlessly staring at my screen in confusion to being able to solve some of these problems, it has been difficult but thats whats needed to see progress.
I had no idea algorithms went this deep, especially not as deep as im sure i'll see them go by the end of this semester. 

#  Linked List Assignment

## Difficult but not the worst
This assignment made me think... THINK, it has been a long time since I've really sat down and coded something like this. While it was Karl teaching the class, it felt like we focused solely on the algorithm aspects and never really delved any deeper.

But this assignment was much, much different; it took a lot of googling and Visual Studio's integrated CoPilot to help me out, but I think assignments like this really do help with solidifying these concepts.



# Data Structure Assignmenmt

## Difficult because it was new to me

this was difficult as it included the usage of Maps, in this case a Dictionary. Until this point I have only ever heard of them, never trying to use them on my own. There was a LOT of googling done and I think I did it right? I'm not too sure to be honest, but this assignment was definitely something that I think was useful.

Like I said, I am not 100% confident this is correct at all, but I believe it is fairly close


# Midterm Reflection

## Overall a very informative semester

Up till this point, there have been many new concepts that were introduced to me, and much renforcement on concepts I already knew of. Completing these assignments definitely has helped me understand how I should be using the tools that C# offers, I hope that over time I can learn another language and apply these same concepts to that language. In a way this class has taught me how to learn. 

# Assignment 5 sorting

## More difficult than I thought

Running through this assignment, there were sorting methods that we had run through either with Cameron or Karl that I still had my code for, making it super easy to implement. But then there were sorting algorithms that either we had not touched up on as much or I simply did not understand as much. This made me do a LOT of research, youtube videos, asking AI to explain them to me and give code examples, tutorials on how to build them and it still took me a fair amount of time. Was it irritating, yes, but I do think it was necessary to struggle through this now rather than later.


# Search Algorithms

## somewhat confusing

This assignment has us use 3 searching algorithms to find a target number, there were times where I was confused how I would approach this assignment. But THANKFULLY, I looked at older code from when Karl was still instructing this class and the solutions for some Leetcodes, and I had already worked through these! So I just needed to implement the Data set and it went pretty smooth!
