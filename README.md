##  Returning to Algorithms

Coming into algorithms after a semester break of writing code that wasn't web development it has been a bit of a struggle

I’ve noticed myself struggling over problems I used to solve with ease.

##  Rebuilding Skills

To get back on track, I’ve been:

- Reviewing old code I previously wrote  
- Practicing problems on LeetCode
- Watching guides on youtube to get myself back into the coding mindset

##  Looking Ahead

Despite the initial struggle, I’m genuinely excited to continue this course since it is much more similar to a real workspace than what my other classes have been.
